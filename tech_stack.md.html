<h4 id="backend-service">Backend Service</h4>
<p><strong>HTTP Restful</strong> server was implemented with Python <strong>Flask</strong> framework to handle
the <strong>POST</strong> requests from the emotion-tracker and the <strong>GET</strong> requests from the
music player.</p>
<p>Face API from <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> was
integrated in the backend to provide analysis of emotion from photo of faces.</p>
<p>User data is stored in the relational <strong>SQLite</strong> database containing
both basic user information and emotion status records.</p>
<p>HTTP Basic Authentication was implemented to ensure the safety of your data. Passwords are hashed with salt using the md5 algorithm and saved in the database.</p>
<p>The entire system is deployed on <strong>Digital Ocean</strong> cloud utilizing <strong>Docker Container</strong> technology.</p>
